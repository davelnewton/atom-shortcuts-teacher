# Shortcuts Teacher

If you launch a command using either a menu or through the [Command
Palette](https://atom.io/packages/command-palette), the Shortcuts Teacher will
pop up a notification informing you about how you can do the same thing using a
keyboard shortcut.

Inspired by the centuries old [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
feature doing the exact same thing.
