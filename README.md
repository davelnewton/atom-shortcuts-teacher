# Shortcuts Teacher

If you launch a command using either a menu or through the [Command
Palette](https://atom.io/packages/command-palette), the Shortcuts Teacher will
pop up a notification informing you about how you can do the same thing using a
keyboard shortcut.

Inspired by the decades old [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
feature doing the exact same thing.

# [TODO](https://github.com/walles/atom-shortcuts-teacher)
* Escape backticks in our shortcut Markdown

* Experiment with putting the shortcuts in a bulleted list?

## DONE
* Make an animated gif showing off the functionality and add it to this
  README.md
* Show only shortcuts for the relevant context
* Don't show duplicate keybinding names
* Put each multi-key keybinding in its own backticks.
* Show human friendly command names
